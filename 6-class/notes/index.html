## CSBC 1000 - Fundamentals of Backend and Blockchain Development

### Class 6: Cryptography and Security 

*Dhruvin Parikh*

</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Class Plan
* Randomness
* Cryptograph in blockchain
* Hashing and transaction security
* Blockchain security

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Scope
* Cryptography techniques applied to blockchain and DLT technologies

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

  ## Randomness
  
  * Without randomness, all operations would be predictable, and therefore insecure
  * Cryptography (and blockchains) could not exist
  * Needed for generating secret keys, encryption protocols, and more
  
  </script></section>
  
  
  
  
  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
  
  *"Any one who considers arithmetical methods of producing random digits is, of course, in a state of sin. For, as has been pointed out several times, there is no such thing as a random number — there are only methods to produce random numbers, and a strict arithmetic procedure of course is not such a method."*
  
  —John von Neumann
  
  </script></section>
  
  
  
  
  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
  
  ## True random processes
  
  * Thermal noise
  * Radioactive decay
  * Network packet arrival times
  * Wiggling mouse/pounding on keyboard (?)
   
  </script></section>
  
  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
  
  ## Pseudo-randomness
  
  * PRNG (Pseudo-Random Number Generator)
    * Deterministic process that generates numbers
  * CSPRNG (Cryptographically Secure PRNG)
    * Must be unpredictable and unbiased
    * "Stretches" the randomness from a "seed" (small value from a true RNG)
  
  </script></section>
  
  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
  
  ## secure random number generator
  
  * Always use a randomness provided by your environment or OS
    * Web-browser: `window.crypto.getRandomValues()`
    * node.js: `crypto.randomBytes()`
    * Linux/OS X: `/dev/urandom`
    * Windows: `RtlGenRandom`
  
  </script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Cryptography

* Way to hash and unhash the messages using a pass key 
* Types of cryptography
  * Symmetric key Cryptography
  * Asymmetric key Cryptography 

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Symmetric key Cryptography

* A sender encrypts a message with a key that has been shared with the receiver over a different channel. 
* The receiver decrypts the message using same key.
* When the sender wants to share another message to a new receiver, they need a new key. 
* This means that there could be as many keys as there are recipients and messages.
* Length of keys : 128 or 256 bits
* Requires sharing of secret key
* Algorithms : RC4, AES, DES, 3DES, etc.
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Symmetric key Cryptography

<div class="left" style="width:50%;">
  <img src="symmetric-encryption.jpeg" style="background-color: white; width: 600px">
</div>
<div class="right" style="width:35%;">
   Sender and receiver generates and uses fresh key every-time to encrypt and decrypt messages.
</div>

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Asymmetric key Cryptography

* Asymmetric Key Cryptography (or Public Key Cryptography) introduces the use of two keys - 
 * a public (verification) key 
 * a private (signing) key. 
* Every network participant has their own public-private key pair. 
* Their public keys are available and visible to everyone, including attackers.
* Length of keys : >=2048 bits
* Algorithms : RSA, ECDSA, Diffie-Hellman 

</script></section>

</div>
<div class="right" style="width:35%;">
   A message signed using public key can be decrypted using private key and vice versa.   
</div>

</script></section>

  
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Public and private keys
  
* Use good randomness to choose a private key
  * Always keep your private key secret!
* Each private key has a corresponding public key
  * Your public key is your bitcoin/ethereum address

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Public keys and addresses

* secp256k public keys are 64 bytes
* Ethereum addresses are 20 bytes
* To compute an ethereum address from a public key:
  * Hash public key with keccak256 (giving 32 bytes)
  * Take *last* 20 bytes of hash
  * Encode as hexadecimal
  * Prefix with "0x"
  * Optional: Compute checksum

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## secp256k private keys

* Randomly choose a 256-bit number
* Almost any number will work, except:
  * `0`
  * Numbers greater than <span style="font-size: 50%">`0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEBAAEDCE6AF48A03BBFD25E8CD0364140`</span>
* If you pick a 256 bit number at random, chance it is a valid private key: <span style="font-size: 50%">`99.999999999999999999999999999999999999626%`</span>

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

  ## Hashing
  * Hashing is the method of passing data into a one way hash-function to generate a string of unrecognizable text called a “hash”. 
  * It is computationally impossible to derive the original input of a hash-function given its output.
  * [hashing demo](https://andersbrownworth.com/blockchain/hash) 

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

  ## Application of Hashing
  * Data Integrity
  * Quick lookups
  * Store/verify password in database
  * Generate Blockchain address
  * Locating blockchain transactions
  * Compressing data    
</script></section>


  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

  ## Hashing in Blockchain
  * The role of hashes in the block structure is to preserve immutability. 
  * The transactions in the block are hashed together with the hash of the previous block. 
  * This hash is then included in the block header for a future block to use. 
  * The genesis block (i.e first block) will have only a hash of the initial transactions from the coinbase (first) account. 
</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

  ## Hashing secures Blockchain
  
  * Even if one transaction changes in a block, the entire block hash would change. 
  * It would cause a break in the chain. 
  * In order to perform a successful rewrite of the blocks
    * Modify the current block and all the previous ones 
    * Convince the miners/validators on the network that this is valid. 
    * Do it before the next block is added. 
    * The longer the chain, the less likely it is that it can be broken.
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

  ## Collision-resistance
  
  * Hard to find any two messages that hash to the same value
  * Formally: Computationally infeasible to find distinct $m$ and $m'$ such that $H(m) = H(m')$
  
  </script></section>
  
  
  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
  
  ## Collision attacks
  
  * Hash functions are almost always attacked by finding collisions, not specific preimages
  * MD5 and SHA1 are insecure because it is easier than it should be to find collisions
    * Both are still practically secure against preimage attacks
  
  </script></section>

    <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## [Sidebar] Keccak/SHA3

* There are 2 separate hash functions: 
* keccak256
* SHA3 (standardised)
* Confusingly, Ethereum folks sometimes say "SHA3", but they *always* mean keccak256
* So be careful when using libraries in various languages!

</script></section>
  
      
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Why hash public keys?

* Smaller (20 bytes instead of 64)
* Can be recovered from signatures anyway (later lesson)
* Quantum computer resistance (sort of)

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## How public/private keys work?

* [Public/Private key demo](https://andersbrownworth.com/blockchain/public-private-keys/keys)
* Demo for generating public private key pair using web3.js
* Comparisons between symmetric and asymmetric key cryptography

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Signatures

Digital signatures let you create messages such as

<i>"I, Alice, send 10 bitcoins to Bob"</i>

... and prove that this message was created by Alice, and not some attacker

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Digital signatures

* A hash after signing a message with a private key.
* A digital signature is use to ensure :
  * The message was sent from a known entity (authentication).
  * The sender cannot deny they sent the message (non-repudiation),
  * The message was not tampered with during its delivery (integrity).
* Digital signatures provide proof of identity or atleast proof of control of an identity and its data.
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Digital signatures

* Bitcoin.
 * Sender would use their private key to sign the transaction and get a message signature. 
 * This is sent to the miners who verify the message signature with the public key of the sender. 
 * If the verification fails then it means the sender of the transaction is not the one who signed it.
 * Signature proves that they are the owner of those bitcoins
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

*If someone tries to tamper with the transaction, the corresponding signature would fail. How are we able to ensure that there is a one-to-one mapping between transaction data and their signatures?*

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Types of signatures

* RSA
* Elliptic curves
* Hash-based
* Lattices

On blockchains, almost always **elliptic curves**

</script></section>
    
    
    
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## secp256k

* This is the type of elliptic curve signature used by Bitcoin, Ethereum, others
* Private keys are 32 bytes
* Public keys are 64 bytes (more on this later)
* Signatures are 64 bytes

</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## How to sign blockchain transaction?

* [Sign blockchain transaction](https://andersbrownworth.com/blockchain/public-private-keys/transaction)
* Demo for signing a transaction using web3.js
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Hash functions

* The core building block of blockchains
* Functions that take an unlimited-size input message $m$ and return a fixed size output $h$:

$h = H(m)$

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
  
## Multi-Signatures

* When several people agree on something, they can all sign same message

<img src="multi-sig-simple.svg" style="background-color: white;" />

</script></section>
  
  
  
  
  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
  
## Schnorr Multi-Signatures

* Schnorr signatures let you combine these into a single signature, that can still be verified

<img src="multi-sig-schnorr.svg" style="background-color: white;" />

</script></section>
  
  
  
  
  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
  
  ## What about encryption?
  
  * Encryption is not used much in blockchains
  * Generally assumed that all information published is publicly visible
  
  </script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Causes of security issues in Blockchain

* Exposing private keys
* Poor storage solutions for keys
* Relinquishing control of keys to centralized parties
* Erroneously creating immature algorithms
* Poor infrastructure security
* Bugs in a smart contract
* 51% attacks
* Replay attacks and double spending

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Replay attacks and double spending

* Risk with cryptocurrencies where the same cash can be spent twice.
* Network attacks where valid data is intercepted in transit, by the originator or an adversary, and then repeated. 
* The goal is to fool the recipient that the attacker is not malicious since they hold valid data.

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Securing Bitcoin against double spending

* only unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) behave as coins
* rule is that every unspent output can be spent only once
* A transaction which tries to spent same UTXO will be considered as double spending. 
* Old transactions can not be replayed, because the output is already spent.

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Securing Ethereum against double spending

* Ethereum has account based model
* Every account has a nonce (number only used once)
* If there are two transactions referring to the same account with the same nonce, then the first will be executed and the second one will be recognized as a double spend
